**Abstract**

We investigates the luminescent behavior of [(CH3)NPh]MnBr4 single crystals, focusing on various phenomena including temperature-dependent PL properties, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves. The compound, composed of the organic moiety methyl aniline (CH3)NPh and inorganic constituents manganese and bromine, exhibits intriguing luminescent properties characterized by efficient radiative recombination and minimal non-radiative losses. A sharp PL peak at 2.35 eV is observed, which decreases in intensity up to 50 K due to non-radiative recombination channels like thermally activated traps, and shows little variation up to 300 K. The TRPL analysis reveals two distinct decay components: a rapid decay on the order of hundreds of ps due to carrier localization in defect states, and a slower decay of approximately ~350 s indicative of trap-mediated processes. These findings highlight the potential for high-efficiency optoelectronic applications, driven by its excellent photophysical properties, a temperature-independent long decay component due to deep trap states, and a temperature-dependent short decay component associated with shallow trap states.
